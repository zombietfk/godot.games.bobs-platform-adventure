PACK: Gore Blood Gibs

--

Pixel-art sprites pack depicting special effects used for gore, blood and gibbing effects when a fleshy human, animal or monster is utterly destroyed by something powerful. Use them to make combat feel massively more satisfying and add realism/believability to the experience.

The main idea is to use a particle system of a game engine to spawn a combination of these things all at once:
- red pixels that spray all over.
- meat chunks/bones/organs as physics enabled objects that can collide with solid terrain.
- animated blood splash particles.
- a glow splash sprite that briefly appears and fades away quickly after start of the gibbing event.
- a glow mist sprite that lingers in the air where the character gibbed and slowly fades into transparency slowly.

Please be mindful of keeping the number of particles sensible/limited per effect, especially if the game project features multiple characters that all could gib at the same time. Performance is important and lag sucks - plan ahead by keeping particles as minimal as they need to be so action and gameplay will remain smooth.
